# Memory Game 

## Project Overview
The Memory Game is a web-based game built with React (frontend) and Node.js/Express (backend). The objective of the game is to match pairs of cards in as few moves as possible, testing the playerâ€™s memory skills. This project was designed to be interactive and engaging, with a 6x6 grid layout, 18 unique pairs, and a timer to track the completion time.

## Features
- **6x6 Grid Layout**: The game board consists of 36 cards (18 pairs).
- **Timer**: Tracks the time it takes to complete the game.
- **Responsive UI**: The game adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Flip Animation**: Smooth transitions when flipping cards.
- **Score Tracking**: Tracks and displays the number of moves taken.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, CSS Grid
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Additional Libraries**: Axios (optional for API calls)
